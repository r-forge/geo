Calculates the distance between each pair of datapoints.
</s-title>
<s-description>
The program calculates the distance between each  pair  of
       datapoints.  The distances are grouped in groups such that
       even number of pairs is in each group.  Then the estimated
       variogram  for  each  group is calculated either by taking
       the mean or by a method from Cressie and  Hawkins  (1980).
       The  latter  method  does  in  essence take the sum of the
       values^0.25. Only pair of points with distance  less  than
       certain  distance are used. Zero - Zero pairs are not used
       if zzp is F.

<s-args-required>
<s-arg name="lat">
Latitude of datapoints.  If  lon=0  lat  is  a  list  with
       components $lat and $lon.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="z">
Values at datapoints.
</s-arg>
</s-args-required>
<s-args-optional>
<s-arg name="lon">
longitude of datapoints.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="nbins">
Number of distance intervals used.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="maxdist">
maximum distance of interest.  Default value is range
       of data*0.7.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="Hawk">
If true the method from Cressie and Hawkins  (1980)  is
       used, else the mean.  Default value is T
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="throwout">
If T datapoints with value zero are not used at  all.
       Default value is F which means that they are used.  In all
       cases zero-zero pairs are not used when the  variogram  is
       estimated.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="scale">
"km" or "Miles". Default is "km".
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="evennumber">
If T distance classes are chosen so  approximately
       the same number of points is in each distance class.  Else
       even distance increments are used.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="zzp">
If true zero-zero pairs are used else not.  Default  value
       is F.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="minnumber">
Distance intervals with minnumber  or  less  pairs
       are not included.  Default is zero.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="col.names">
if lat is a dataframe col.names should contain the
       names  of  the vectors containing the x and y coordinates,
       default is c("lat","lon")
</s-arg>
</s-args-optional>
<s-section name = "Value">
A     list     with     the     following      components:
<s-example>

          number:   Number  of  pair  in each distance class.
          dist:     Mean distance  in  each  distance  class.
          vario:    variogram  for  each  distance class.
</s-example>
The list is suitable for the program variofit.  The  variogram
       can also be plotted by plvar(vagram,fit=F)
