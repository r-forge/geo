<H1>interpolates regularly spaced data on a grid.
</H1>
<H2> DESCRIPTION: </H2>The function interpolates regularly spaced data on a grid.
       The  program  uses  inverse  distance  method  that  takes
       clustering into account.  Under  certain  conditions  this
       method  can  be  called  kriging.   For each gridpoint the
       program  looks  for  neighbourhood  points  according   to
       certain  criteria.   The  program  has  a  possibility  to
       prevent smearing data out from one area to  another  where
       it is not wanted like between two fjords.  The program has
       the possibility of universal kriging  with  the  drift  in
       lat,lon or due to an external variable.
<H2> USAGE: </H2>
<PRE>pointkriging(lat, lon, z, xgr, vagram, maxnumber=16, scale=&quot;km&quot;,
             option=1, maxdist=0, rat=3, nb=8, set=0, areas=0,
             varcalc=F, sill=0, minnumber=2, suboption=1, outside=T,
             degree=0, lognormal=F, zeroset=F)
</PRE>

<H2> REQUIRED ARGUMENTS: </H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>lat</B>
</DT><DD>
Latitude of datapoints.
</DD>
<DT><B>lon</B>
</DT><DD>
Longitude of datapoints.
</DD>
<DT><B>z</B>
</DT><DD>
Values at datapoints.
</DD>
<DT><B>xgr</B>
</DT><DD>
Description of the grid. Can be output from program grid
or just a list with components $lat and $lon.
</DD>
<DT><B>vagram</B>
</DT><DD>
Components of the variogram, a  list  with  a  least 3 components, $sill, $nugget & $rang1.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2> OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS: </H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>maxnumber</B>
</DT><DD>
Number of neighbourhood points used ,  default  is
       16.  In some cases 16 points are not found.
</DD>
<DT><B>scale</B>
</DT><DD>
Scale "km" or "miles", default is "miles".
</DD>
<DT><B>option</B>
</DT><DD>
Option  used  for  selecting   neighbourhood   points.
       Allowed  values  1,2,3  and 4.  Default value is one.  For
       further information see below.
</DD>
<DT><B>maxdist</B>
</DT><DD>
If option = 4 all points within maxdist are used.  If
       option  =  4  the default value of maxdist is the range of
       the variogram.  maxdist has also meaning when option = 1,2
       or  3.   In  those  cases  points  further  away  from any
       datapoint than maxdist are set to zero,  mean z or NA.
</DD>
<DT><B>rat</B>
</DT><DD>
The number of points in the first step of  the  search  is
       rat*maxnumber.
</DD>
<DT><B>nb</B>
</DT><DD>
Parameter  describing  the  extent  of  the  area   where
       neighbourhood  points  are  searched  in  the first round.
       Default value is 8 which means  that  and  area  of  16x16
       gridpoints is searched.
</DD>
<DT><B>set</B>
</DT><DD>
Points outside region or further away  than  maxdist  from
       any  datapoint   are set to either zero (set=0) or mean(z)
       set=1 or NA set =-1.
</DD>
<DT><B>areas</B>
</DT><DD>
A list defining a  number  of  areas.   NA  is  between
       areas.    Points   in   different  areas  are  treated  as
       independed.  Two neighbourhood fjords could be defined  as
       different  areas  so  the  program  does  not  interpolate
       between them.
</DD>
<DT><B>varcalc</B>
</DT><DD>
If varcalc is true the estimation  variance  at  each
       datapoint is calculated. Default value is F.
</DD>
<DT><B>sill</B>
</DT><DD>
 Sill in variance calculations.  Default  value  is  the
       sill of the variogram.
</DD>
<DT><B>minnumber</B>
</DT><DD>
If number of neighbourhood points  found  is  less
       than or equal to minnumber the point is considered outside
       the areas covered by the datapoints and  set  to  NA,0  or
       mean(z)
</DD>
<DT><B>suboption</B>
</DT><DD>
 If option = 4 and more than maxnumber  points  are
       found in the area the program switches to option 1, 2 or 3
       in the point search.  Default value is 1.
</DD>
<DT><B>outside</B>
</DT><DD>
 If outside is T points further  away  from  the  area
       than  nb*dx  are  excluded.  dx is the grid interval.  Too
       many points outside of the area can problems in the search
       because the grid is used to divide the area in squares and
       everything left and  below  the  first  gridpoint  is  for
       example one square.
</DD>
<DT><B>degree</B>
</DT><DD>
Degree of drift polynomial for universal kriging.  0, 1
       or 2.  Default 0.
</DD>
<DT><B>lognormal</B>
</DT><DD>
</DD>
<DT><B>zeroset</B>
</DT><DD>
</DD>
</DL>
<H2> VALUE: </H2>
<DL>A vector with the calculated values at the gridpoints.
</DL>

<H2> SIDE EFFECTS: </H2>
The program is partly written in C so if it crashes  Splus
       is exited.
<H2> Details: </H2>
 <P>
       The area covered  by  the  gridpoints  is   divided   into
       rectangular elements with the gridpoints at the corners of
       the  elements.   For  each  gridpoints  the   search   for
       neighbourhood points is done in two steps.
       
<PRE>
              1. Neighbourhood elements searched for points.  How
                 far away the element searched are is defined  by 
                 the parameter nb. This step returns in most cases
                 more points than will be used.

              2. Select the final list of  neighbourhood  points.
                 4 different algorithms are available.
                  1.  Select the nearest points.
                  2.  4 directions are selected 0 - 90, 90 - 180,
                      180 - 270 and 270 - 360 degrees. The program
                      selects the nearest points but weighs more
                      points in  direction with few points.
                  3.  8 direction selected.
                  4.  All points within maxdist selected.
       
</PRE>

       If too many points are  found  in  option  4  the  program
       switches to some other options.

       When the neighbourhood points have been selected the value
       is  calculated  using  kriging.   The  user can either use
       variogram found from the data or some other variogram.  By
       changing nugget/sill and range the degree of smoothing can
       be controlled.   High  nugget/sill  generally  means  much
       smoothing.   It  is  not  desirable to use low nugget/sill
       (lower than 0.01 - 0.05) if any two  datapoints  are  near
       each  other.   If  nugget/sill >= 0.01 - 0.05 two datapoints
       can be in the same location  without  problems. Two too much correlated datapoints cause numerical problems.
