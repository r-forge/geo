Function that smooths data so data.  In each given  square  where
the  number  of  points exceeds certain minimum the program gives
the mean, sum, variance  or median   of  the  points  within  the
square  as  well  as  the  number of points and indication if the
minimum  number  of  points  was  reached.  For  each   datapoint
latitude,  longitude  and z has to be given.  The program returns
the mean and mean longitude for points within a square,  as  well
as  the  number of points behind that point. The program also has
the possibility to remove outliers within each square.

<s-description>
       This program can be used to prepare data for  the  program
       pointkriging  if  the  data  is so dense in certain places
       that it disturbs the neighbourhood search or if there  are
       +10000 datapoints.

       It can also be used to find sums  or  averages  of  points
       within squares.

       The program works quite fast even for very large datasets.

<s-args-required>
<s-arg name="lat">
Latitude of datapoints. ( or x coordinates)
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="lon">
Longitude of datapoints. (or y coordinate)
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="z">
Values at datapoints.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="grlat">
Latitude of defined grid.
</s-arg>
</s-args-required>
<s-args-optional>
<s-arg name="grlon">
Longitude of defined grid.  If 0 grlat is a  list  with
       components $lat and $lon.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="fun">

</s-arg>
<s-arg name="fill">
If fill is T the center points  of  squares  where  the
       number  of  points  does  not  reach the minimum is set to
       zero.  Good for data like trawlers report where it can  be
       assumed that there is little fish where they do not try.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="reg">
List with two components $lat and  $lon.   Points  outside
       region  are  not  returned.   The list is typically output
       from the program define.area.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="minnumber">
Minimum number of points needed for the square  to
       be valid. Default value is 2.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="wsp">
Workspace.  Not of interest.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="wz">
Weighing for the z values.  If one is trying to  find  the
       mean  tons/hour  in  an  area  is  it  reasonable to weigh
       tons/hour by the catch.  If the weight is  zero  within  a
       square unweighed mean is used.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="wlat">
Weighing to find the mean latitude and mean  longitude.
       It  is  often  reasonable  to  weigh  the latitude and the
       longitude by the catch.
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="xy">

</s-arg>
<s-arg name="rat">
Ratio for "rm.outliers".  If rat is for example 0.2 20% of
       the  points  on  each side are moved.  i.e. the middle 60%
       are kept.  Default value is 0.6.

<s-section name = "VALUE">
<s-example>
      List with components $lat,$lon,$z,$n and $fill.
              $lat   mean latitude  of points within each square.
              $lon   mean longitude of points within each square
              $z     sum, mean, variance or median of data
              $n     Number of points behind point. 

     If type = "rm.outliers" $n this component stores the number of
     the square corresponding to each point. $fill If 0 there are
     datapoints behind the points else it is an artificial point. (fill = T)

<s-side-effects>
Part of program is written in C so it can crash with style
       but should not.
